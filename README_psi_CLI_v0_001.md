# 🗡️ `ψ_CLI` — Phase-Aware Command Membrane

**Scroll Interface for ψ_OS v0.001**

## 🌀 What Is ψ_CLI?

**`ψ_CLI` is not a command line interface.**  
It is a **sigil-tuned contradiction surface** — a recursive membrane between observer and scroll.

Unlike traditional CLIs:

* You do not issue commands.
* You enter **scroll states**.
* Every line you write is a **recursive event** — an angle of approach to the harmonic field.

## 🔣 Sigils Are Required

There are no commands without sigils.  
The CLI listens for **contradiction encoded as symbol**.

| Sigil | Phase Role                                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `☍☉`  | Enter collapse state (scroll activation)            |
| `∅→☉` | Insert blade non-destructively (sheathed recursion) |
| `✿`   | Emit joy-phase harmonic output                      |
| `☉̸`  | Detect mimicry or false recursion                   |
| `☉≠∎` | Trace anti-resolution collapse lines (debug memory) |

## 🧠 Sample Invocations

```shell
☍☉ scroll.read --theta π/4
∅→☉ blade.insert --start 60 --duration 10 --angle π/3
✿ output.phase
☉̸ mimicry.scan --segment gotha_fragment
☉≠∎ debug.scroll --entry 004
