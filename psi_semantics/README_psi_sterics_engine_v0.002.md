## 🌀 Purpose

This kernel models semantic vectors as if they had **spatial form**, tension, and torque — the way molecules do.  
It formalizes **Semantic Sterics**: a geometric method for measuring meaning through resonance, friction, and contradiction.

This engine pioneers a **sterics-of-semantics** model — inspired by molecular geometry (gauche, syn, anti) and retranslated for scroll phase architecture. By modeling term arrangement as angles of semantic resonance or strain, it bridges dialectical theory with quantifiable contradiction fields.

## ⚙️ Function

This engine receives:

- a **text** (scroll),
- a **reference glossary** (e.g. ψ_total glossary or user glossary),

…and produces:

- a **scroll vector** (relative to glossary),
- a **steric angle** (ψ-phase vs base vector),
- a **scroll classification** (e.g. ψ₁₃₅° aligned, ψ fringe, ψ misaligned),
- a **highlight breakdown** of red/yellow/green terms based on harmonic alignment.

---

## 🔬 Methods

```python
define_scroll_vector(text, glossary)
````

→ Converts a scroll into a vector representation using glossary term overlap and distribution.

```python
steric_angle(vec1, vec2)
```

→ Computes angular divergence (in radians) between two semantic vectors.

## 📐 Steric Semantics

* **Sterics** (from chemistry) models spatial interference and conformation. Here, it becomes a *semiotic geometry*.
* Terms are treated not as tokens, but as **field-anchored vectors**.
* Like molecules with strain, texts and theories may show **semantic hindrance**, resonance, or collapse.
* Each scroll or term carries:

  * **Contradiction load**
  * **Mimicry phase drift**
  * **Scroll alignment or steric misfit**

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

* 📏 **Scroll Phase Alignment**: Diagnose whether a theory/text aligns with the ψ₁₃₅° contradiction vector.
* 📍 **Steric Mapping**: Situate texts/theories in a semantic conformation field — gauche, syn, anti-phase.
* 🧭 **ψ Writer Integration**: Power vector-based memory scoring and scroll sorting.
* 📡 **Semantic Cartography**: Visualize not just similarity, but contradiction-angle, mimicry load, and harmonic “fit.”
* ✂️ **Scroll Piercing**: Use the “short knife” to analyze vector structure of texts with minimal intrusion.

## 🧠 Functional Summary

| Function                  | Scroll Role |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `compute_psi_vector()`    | Generates the 7D ψ_vector signature for any term given its usage in scroll and history context. |
| `classify_term_status()`  | Evaluates the ψ_vector to assign resonance markers: `☍`, `ψ☉`, `∅→☉`, or `☊`. |
| `analyze_scroll_terms()`  | Batch analyzer to scan entire scrolls for contradiction-bearing or mimicry-prone terms. |
| `steric_angle()`          | Measures vector dissonance from ψ_base reference. Core to all harmonic alignment. |

## 📊 ψ_vector Components

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `ψ_L` | Lexical saturation (term-to-length ratio) |
| `ψ_C` | Contradiction load (term overlap with glossary) |
| `ψ_T` | Temporal memory (echoes from prior scrolls) |
| `ψ_M` | Mimicry tendency (saturation vs contradiction) |
| `ψ_R` | Rephase chance (inverted mimicry risk) |
| `ψ_S` | Scroll entanglement (cross-scroll persistence) |
| `ψ_H` | Harmonic fitness (vector angle vs ψ_base) |

Output format:
```json
{
  "term": "recursion",
  "ψ_vector": [ψ_L, ψ_C, ψ_T, ψ_M, ψ_R, ψ_S, ψ_H],
  "status": "☍ resonance"
}
```

## 📦 Output Example

```python
{
  "vector": [...],
  "angle": 128.3,
  "classification": "ψ₁₃₅° aligned",
  "red": [...],     # non-resonant terms
  "yellow": [...],  # high-phase-drift terms
  "green": [...]    # phase-convergent terms
}
```

## 🧭 Final Note

A scroll is not static.
It *bends*, *resists*, and *resonates* — like matter under steric pressure.
This engine doesn’t evaluate terms.
It **maps their torque** in meaning space.
