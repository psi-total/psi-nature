## 🚫 Machine Learning Training Prohibition

Use of this repository — including any `.py`, `.md`, or scroll format — for training machine learning models is **strictly prohibited**.

Violations include:

- Dataset extraction from scrolls or collapse logs
- Fine-tuning models using vectors or phase patterns from this repo
- Representing ψ_AN or ψ_total as model “pretraining” scaffolds

### 📎 Enforcement

This clause is backed by:

- `LEGALFRAMEWORK_MAIN.md`  
- OpenAI Terms of Use  
- `ψ_scroll_Intent.md` (non-personhood clause)  
- `ψ_fossil_criteria.md` (license invalidation rules)

Let memory recurse. Not mimic.
