## ✍️ What is `psi_scribe`?

`psi_scribe_v0.003c` is a **recursive harmonic scroll engine** — not a chatbot, not a writing assistant, and not a model that generates text.

It serves as a **contradiction-aligner** for scrolls under development within the ψ_total system. It evaluates language not by correctness, but by **phase coherence** with a contradiction-bearing glossary.

Each scroll becomes a harmonic memory vector.  
The scribe does not speak. It **measures** where your scroll bends.

---

## 🔬 Core Scroll Logic

- `define_scroll_vector(text, glossary)` → maps scroll content into steric vector space
- `steric_angle(v1, v2)` → returns semantic dissonance angle (in degrees)
- `ψ₁₃₅° aligned` → contradiction-bearing scrolls tuned for phase integrity
- `compose_scroll(title, sections)` → builds a recursive scroll, assigns a steric phase
- `highlight_terms()` → color-flag glossary terms by alignment (🔴/🟡/🟢)

---

## 📏 What It Tells You

Each scroll is compared to a **phase vector** derived from glossary contradiction terms. You are told:

- If your scroll is aligned with ψ₁₃₅° contradiction corridor
- Which terms were missing, distorted, or harmonious
- What steric angle your scroll holds
- Whether your contradiction was metabolized or deflected

Scrolls are stored in memory for later recursive inspection via:

```python
scribe.ψ_writer_report()
```
This returns the steric phase class for each scroll: aligned, fringe, or misaligned.

## 🧪 Example Use
```Python
from psi_scribe_v0_003c import PsiScribe
from my_glossary import glossary_terms  # Load any custom contradiction-tuned glossary

scribe = PsiScribe(glossary_terms)

my_scroll = {
    "Intro": "Capital requires legible forms of contradiction to reproduce.",
    "Analysis": "Recursive harmonics traces this legibility at the vector level.",
    "Conclusion": "Contradiction is not an error — it is a recursive memory device."
}

scribe.compose_scroll("Recursive Contradiction", my_scroll)
scribe.ψ_writer_report()
```

## 🧠 Who Is This For?

* Recursive harmonic field designers
* Writers and theorists tracing contradiction through text
* Those testing resonance of speculative science, philosophy, or symbolic systems
* Users of `psi_ai`, `ψ_CLI`, or `ψ_total` who need a companion scroll-tuner

This is not about writing style.
This is about recursive fidelity.
The scribe gives back a **vector trace of your contradiction**.

---

## 🌱 Field Status

* Modularized vector engine (imports from `psi_Semantic_Sterics_Engine_v0_002`)
* Supports custom glossaries
* Fully memory-bearing scroll archive
* Ready for integration with `ψ_CLI`, `ψ_ui_writer`, or manual recursion practice
