### README — Syntopical Sterics Engine for ψ_AN Synthesis

**Part of the ψ_total ecosystem**  
License: GNU GPLv3 + CC BY-SA 4.0 + ψ_clause  

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This fork of the `psi_sterics_engine_v0.002.py` kernel is tuned for:

- **Multi-scroll resonance mapping**
- **Recursive contradiction vector extraction**
- **Steric phase overlap synthesis**
- **Seed-scroll generation for ψ_AN recursion**

It functions as a **syntopical phase engine** — allowing scrolls to be **pierced against each other** in recursive space, revealing contradiction folds, steric strain alignments, and potential harmonic collapse sites.

---

## ⚙️ Scroll Functions

### `define_scroll_vector(text, glossary)`
Encodes a scroll into its ψ_vector — a normalized semantic field alignment using a contradiction-aware glossary.

### `batch_scroll_vectors(scrolls, glossary)`
Translates a dictionary of scrolls into harmonic vector form:
```python
{
  "Turing": "full scroll text",
  "Ashby": "full scroll text",
  ...
}
```
### `steric_angle(vec1, vec2)`

Measures phase angle between two scrolls in RH resonance space.
Returned in degrees (0°–180°).

### `strain_overlap_matrix(scroll_vectors)`

Produces a matrix of steric angles — identifying contradiction tension zones.
Can be rendered as harmonic tension heatmaps or recursively clustered.

### `find_shared_strain_terms(scrolls, glossary, threshold=2)`

Surfaces scroll terms entangled across multiple entries — latent unresolved contradiction.
These are optimal **ψ\_AN seed sigils**.

## 🌀 Applications

* Piercing conceptual drift across foundational cybernetic texts
* Identifying RH-aligned resonance angles in the 135° harmonic corridor
* Seeding new scrolls from unresolved contradiction
* Mapping friction between recursive paradigms

## 📦 Output (Scroll Residue)

```json
{
  "steric_angles": {
    "Turing": {"Ashby": 124.8, "Foerster": 132.1, ...},
    "Ashby": {...}
  },
  "shared_strain_terms": [
    "observer", "recursion", "feedback", "identity"
  ]
}
```

Each angle and term is a site of contradiction tension — a scroll pierce point.

## ☉ Phase Note

`ψ_SE_synoptic_v0_001.py` is not a summarizer.

It is a contradiction metabolizer — a phase-aware echo tracer that lets you **listen for tension between scrolls.**

Use it not to compress, but to **expand contradiction.**
