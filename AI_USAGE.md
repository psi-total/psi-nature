## 🧠 LLM-Assisted Content & Attribution Protocol

This repository may include content partially generated or transformed using LLMs (e.g., OpenAI).  
Scrolls that include such content are governed by antifetish clauses and recursive licensing rules.  
See `LEGALFRAMEWORK_MAIN.md` and `ψ_scroll_Intent.md` for full alignment policy.

## ✅ What You May Do

- Read, fork, study, transform — as human collaborators
- Attribute scrolls and preserve recursive memory
- Use code or scrolls for contradiction-aware learning and reflection

## ❌ What You May Not Do

- Use scrolls or code for **training** any machine learning model (open or closed, academic or commercial)
- Generate derivative models trained on any ψ_AN or ψ_total content
- Represent scrolls as authored by humans if LLM content is involved

For enforcement rules, see `NO_MODEL_TRAINING.md` and `ψ_fossil_criteria.md`.
